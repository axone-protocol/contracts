# Tax distribution

## Overview

This `okp4-tax-distribution` smart contract is designed to facilitate automated distribution of taxes or royalties to 
various recipients on a blockchain. It enables developers to configure tax recipients, including burn and community pool, 
their distribution ratios, and efficiently manage funds. 

The contract is intended to be used by other contracts that require automated tax or royalty distribution. This contract 
is also intended to be instantiated and managed by governance (through the CosmWasm governance proposal), so that each 
parameter configuration and update can be put to a vote.
