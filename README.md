## ✨ Smart Contracts

This repository hosts Smart Contracts that are deployed on the [OKP4 network](http://okp4.network). But they are compatible with any
[Cosmos blockchains](https://cosmos.network/) that uses the [CosmWasm](https://cosmwasm.com/) framework.

## 🗂 Directory Structure

The project is structured around a set of Rust workspaces, each defining a smart contract.

## 🏗 Build

### Pre-requisites

Be sure you have the following tools installed:

- [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install) v1.63.0 or higher
- [cargo-make](https://github.com/sagiegurari/cargo-make) v0.36.3 or higher
- [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/)
- [jq](https://stedolan.github.io/jq/download/) v1.6 or higher
- [jsonschema2md](https://github.com/adobe/jsonschema2md) v7.1.15 or higher

And the following common [GNU Core utilities](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_GNU_Core_Utilities_commands):

- [shasum](https://linuxhint.com/shasum-linux/) v6.02 or higher
- [sed](https://www.gnu.org/software/sed/) v4.8 or higher

### Compiling Smart Contracts to Wasm

To compile the Smart Contracts to Wasm, just invoke the `wasm` goal of the makefile:

```sh
cargo make wasm
```

This will install the rust Wasm toolchain, if not already done, and start the process for compiling the Smart Contracts
to Wasm.

### Test Smart Contracts

The Smart Contracts are under unit testing. The tests can be launched with the following invocation:

```sh
cargo make test-coverage
```

## 🏓 Play with the Smart Contracts

The project comes with a set of convenient tasks to manage the Smart Contracts and the blockchain.
To see the list of available tasks, run the following command:

```sh
cargo make --list-all-steps | grep chain | sort | sed -r 's/chain(-?[a-zA-Z\-]*)/- `chain\1`/'
```

The list of available tasks for managing the chain is as follows:

- `chain` - Run the okp4d CLI using the chain's home directory under a Docker container.
- `chain-add-keys` - Add a set of predefined keys (recovered from the seed phrases) to the chain.
- `chain-clean` - Clean the chain data (⚠️ definitively)
- `chain-deploy-contract` - Deploy a specific contract to the chain. The contract must be compiled and the wasm file must be present in the artifacts directory (under target/wasm32-unknown-unknown/...).
- `chain-deploy-contracts` - Deploy all the available contracts to the chain (under target/wasm32-unknown-unknown/...).
- `chain-execute-contract` - Execute a command on a specific contract to the chain. The contract must be already deployed and instantiated.
- `chain-init-folder` - Initialize deploy folder to make sure scripts have the right permission (needed for linux)
- `chain-initialize` - Initialize the chain with a validator's key and a set of predefined keys. ⚠️ The home directory is cleaned before.
- `chain-inspect-contract` - Inspect a specific contract deployed to the chain.
- `chain-instantiate-contract` - Instantiate a specific contract to the chain. The contract must be already deployed.
- `chain-list-contracts` - List all the contracts deployed to the chain.
- `chain-logs` - Show the chain's container logs.
- `chain-query-contract` - Query a specific contract to the chain. The contract must be already deployed and instantiated.
- `chain-start` - Run the full node okp4d application using the chain's home directory under a Docker container.
- `chain-stop` - Stop the chain's container.

### Initialize the chain

To initialize the chain, just run:

```sh
cargo make chain-initialize
```

This will initialize the chain's home directory and create a validator's key and a set of predefined keys
(recovered from the seed phrases).

### Start the chain

To start the chain, just run:

```sh
cargo make chain-start
```

This will start the chain's container and run the full node wasmd application.

You can check the chain's logs with:

```sh
cargo make chain-logs
```

### Deploy the Smart Contracts

To deploy the Smart Contracts, just run:

```sh
cargo make chain-deploy-contracts
```

This will deploy all the available contracts to the chain. For this, the contracts must be compiled and the wasm files
must be present in the artifacts directory. See the [Build](#-build) section for more details.

Now, you can interact with the deployed smart contracts and test them out.

### Free execution of the CLI command

You can freely interact with the local chain by executing the following CLI command. This will execute the `okp4d`
binary
inside a Docker container with the `--home` argument pointing to the chain's home directory and using the same network
as
the chain's container. The arguments passed to the command will be directly passed to the `okp4d` binary.

```sh
cargo make chain <command>
```

For example, to check the status of the chain, just run:

```sh
cargo make chain status
```

### Stop the chain

To stop the chain, just run:

```sh
cargo make chain-stop
```

### Clean the chain

To clean the chain, just run:

```sh
cargo make chain-clean
```

⚠️ Please be cautious when running this command as it will completely clean the chain's home directory and the action is
irreversible.

## Documentation

To generate the documentation follow the steps below.

### Tools installation

Be sure you have the following tools installed:

- [Yarn](https://classic.yarnpkg.com/en/docs/install) v1.22.10 or higher

Then, install the dependencies:

```sh
yarn global add @adobe/jsonschema2md@7.1.5
```

### Generate the documentation

To generate the documentation, just run:

```sh
cargo make schema
cargo make generate_docs
```

You'll find the generated documentation under the `docs` folder.

### Commit the documentation

When developing a new contract, you should commit the generated documentation to the repository. For this, gerenate the
documentation and commit the changes:

```sh
git commit -am "docs: update generated documentation"
```
