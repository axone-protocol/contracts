# Objectarium

## Overview

The `okp4-objectarium` smart contract enables the storage of arbitrary `objects` in any [Cosmos blockchains](https://cosmos.network/) using the [CosmWasm](https://cosmwasm.com/) framework.

This contract allows for storing `objects`, pinning and unpinning `objects` for a given sender address, and it also includes the ability to remove (forget) `objects` if they are no longer pinned.

## Usage

### Instantiate

The `okp4-objectarium` can be instantiated as follows, refer to the schema for more information on configuration, limits and pagination configuration:

```bash
okp4d tx wasm instantiate $CODE_ID \
    --label "my-storage" \
    --from $ADDR \
    --admin $ADMIN_ADDR \
    --gas 1000000 \
    --broadcast-mode block \
    '{"bucket":"my-bucket","limits":{}, "config": {}, "pagination": {}}'
```

### Execute

We can store an object by providing its data in base64 encoded, we can pin the stored object to prevent it from being removed:

```bash
okp4d tx wasm execute $CONTRACT_ADDR \
    --from $ADDR \
    --gas 1000000 \
    --broadcast-mode block \
    "{\"store_object\":{\"data\": \"$(cat my-data | base64)\",\"pin\":true}}"
```

The object id is stable as it is a hash, we can't store an object twice.

With the following commands we can pin and unpin existing objects:

```bash
okp4d tx wasm execute $CONTRACT_ADDR \
    --from $ADDR \
    --gas 1000000 \
    --broadcast-mode block \
    "{\"pin_object\":{\"id\": \"$OBJECT_ID\"}}"

okp4d tx wasm execute $CONTRACT_ADDR \
    --from $ADDR \
    --gas 1000000 \
    --broadcast-mode block \
    "{\"unpin_object\":{\"id\": \"$OBJECT_ID\"}}"
```

And if an object is not pinned, or pinned by the sender of transaction, we can remove it:

```bash
okp4d tx wasm execute $CONTRACT_ADDR \
    --from $ADDR \
    --gas 1000000 \
    --broadcast-mode block \
    "{\"forget_object\":{\"id\": \"$OBJECT_ID\"}}"
```

### Query

Query an object by its id:

```bash
okp4d query wasm contract smart $CONTRACT_ADDR \
    "{\"object\": {\"id\": \"$OBJECT_ID\"}}"
```

Or its data:

```bash
okp4d query wasm contract smart $CONTRACT_ADDR \
    "{\"object_data\": {\"id\": \"$OBJECT_ID\"}}"
```

We can also list the objects, eventually filtering on the object owner:

```bash
okp4d query wasm contract smart $CONTRACT_ADDR \
    "{\"objects\": {\"address\": \"okp41p8u47en82gmzfm259y6z93r9qe63l25dfwwng6\"}}"
```

And navigate in a cursor based pagination:

```bash
okp4d query wasm contract smart $CONTRACT_ADDR \
    "{\"objects\": {\"first\": 5, \"after\": \"23Y5t5DBe7DkPwfJo3Sd26Y8Z9epmtpA1FTpdG7DiG6MD8vPRTzzbQ9TccmyoBcePkPK6atUiqcAzJVo3TfYNBGY\"}}"
```

We can also query object pins with the same cursor based pagination:

```bash
okp4d query wasm contract smart $CONTRACT_ADDR \
    "{\"object_pins\": {\"id\": \"$OBJECT_ID\", \"first\": 5, \"after\": \"23Y5t5DBe7DkPwfJo3Sd26Y8Z9epmtpA1FTpdG7DiG6MD8vPRTzzbQ9TccmyoBcePkPK6atUiqcAzJVo3TfYNBGY\"}}"
```
